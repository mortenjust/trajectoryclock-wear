# trajectoryclock-wear
A watch face that shows when you'll be home if you leave now

You get two sets of hands. One set that shows the current time, and one set that shows your ETA for home if you leave now.

## Want to compile this?
I'm a horrible Android noob, and as of right now I can't open the Android Studio project. It's probably not a big deal if you know what Gradle means. 

Pull requests are more than welcome. Some ideas: 

* Fixing the Android Studio project
* Making the home address user-configurable
